# CozyVader
A cross-platform project for an appllication that rolls dice. The best dice. Like, totally rolls them.
Tuned down a notch since simple and done > ambitious and dead.

How it got its name:
Formerly sporting the incredibly creative name "RollApp", is has since found a new name: CozyVader.
Stemming from the greek word for die, 'hexaeder' (hexahedron in English) and the greek word for twenty, 'eikosi', we arrive at 'eikosieder'.
Phonetically, this sounds like "Ayy Cozy Ader". Losing the youthful "Ayy" and nerding it up a notch, CozyVader was born.
